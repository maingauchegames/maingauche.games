description: In which we deploy the third patch

This is a quick little update, coming hot on the heels of the [one we made yesterday](./20220818-stereo-boy-patch-2/). A day-after patch usually implies that we broke something with the previous update, and that's definitely true in this case.

We found a bug that might cause stability issues if you die while pushing a block. We weren't actually able to get the game to crash in these cases, but we thought it would be a good idea to ship a fix anyway.

As always, feel free to [let us know](mailto:info@maingauche.games) if you run into any issues!
