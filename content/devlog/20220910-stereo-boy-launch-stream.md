Our launch day stream was really fun! We got to play Stereo Boy, answer questions, and demonstrate some of the tools we used to make the game.

Watch for some fun screenshots that show how far the game has come since its inception as a game jam entry.

By the way: we stream and post videos about game dev from time to time. Follow us on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/maingauchegames) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPMLP_iuTLQWxCVYFNt40WA) for more!
